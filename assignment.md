# Assignment: Exploring Real-World Code Examples
## Introduction
In our everyday lives, we interact with a myriad of software applications, often without realizing the complex code that powers them. From the moment we silence our morning alarm, to checking the weather forecast, or even making an online purchase, software is an integral part of our daily routine. As we embark on our journey to learn coding, it's essential to understand how these applications are built and function. This assignment, designed for beginners, leverages our newly acquired skills in using GitHub and other online repositories. It's an opportunity to explore and connect with the real-world applications of code.

## Objective
Your task is to delve into the world of coding by finding real-life examples of code that power the software applications you use daily. This exercise will help you understand how theoretical coding concepts are applied in practical, real-world scenarios.

## Assignment Details
Research and Exploration: Using online repositories like GitHub, search for code examples that align with the everyday software applications described in the provided prose blurbs.

Link and Line Numbers: For each example, provide the link to the code repository and specify the exact line numbers where the relevant code is located. This will help you practice navigating through code repositories and understanding code structure.

Documentation: Along with each link, write a brief description of what the code does and how it relates to the functionality of the application in the real world.

## Prose Blurbs for Exploration
- Code that specifies when an alarm clock should start making audible sounds.
- Code for a rocket targeting system.
- File compression utility algorithm.
- Weather forecasting algorithm.
- E-commerce checkout system process.
- Social media post scheduler.
- Fitness app calorie counter.
- Online voting system mechanics.
- Automated email response system.

## Submission Format

Document Title: "Exploring Code in Daily Life"
Content Structure: For each of the nine blurbs, include a heading with the blurb title, followed by your findings (link and line numbers) and a brief description. Also, do the same for 3 kinds of tools you use every day (for example: how the email app knows there are new messages, how my calendar adds new items, how my video game authenticates my user/password)
Length: No more than two paragraphs per blurb.
Evaluation Criteria
Accuracy: Correctly identifying relevant sections of code.
Clarity: Clear and concise descriptions of how the code functions.
Research Skills: Ability to effectively use online resources like GitHub.

Code that specifies when an alarm clock should start making audible sounds 

https://github.com/ROSHAN-KHANDAGALE/Alarm-Clock/blob/main/main.py 

	Lines 6-17

Description: Lines 6-14 shows the alarm clock in its snooze stage, and it’s taking into account the current time, if the current time isn’t the time required before it rings. When it rings, it’ll play a beep noise and show the text “Alarm is Ringing!”. 


File Compression Utility Algorithm 

https://github.com/ayonious/File-Compression/blob/master/src/main/java/prog/Lzipping.java 

	Lines 156-245
Description: Lines 156-245 shows the process of a file being compressed into a zip. 


Weather Forecasting Algorithm 

https://github.com/Naman-Bhalla/Weather_Forecasting_Sliding_Window_Algorithm/blob/master/main.py 

Description: Lines 10-37 shows the process of predicting and forecasting weather. From what I’ve seen, it looks like if the year is the current year, it has 7 slots, which depending on the value of the slot will give us max temperature, min temperature, humidity, or rainfall. 

E-Commerce checkout system process

https://github.com/PaymentsHubDevelopers/PaymentsHub-React-Browser-Post-API-With-Shopping-Cart/blob/main/src/pages/Payment.jsx 

Description: Lines 6-37 shows the process of reading and approving cards for payment when checking out items. It’s kind of like the machine used in stores/restaurants that you can insert/tap/swipe with to pay for your stuff without having cash. 


Social Media Post Scheduler 

https://github.com/theju/smp/blob/master/scheduler/tests.py

Description: Lines 68-75 shows the process of scheduling a time to post the media. 

Fitness App Calorie Counter

https://github.com/erleiuat/minska/blob/master/src/views/Secure/Calories.vue 

Description: Lines 123-140 shows the process of fetching calorie counts from a specific day. 

Automated email response system

https://gist.github.com/fgsoap/b74c3b436e5c4af6f1bc 

Description: Lines 4-40 shows the process of sending an automated email response system and replying to people signing up with a certain email to be given an automatic response. 

	
Online voting system mechanics 

https://github.com/neatek/GameVoting/blob/master/addons/sourcemod/scripting/gamevoting.sp 

Description: Lines 29-612 shows the process of code where it shows online voting game mechanics such as clearing votes, starting votes, setting the choice of a player, and etc. 


Code for a rocket targeting system

https://github.com/solar138/RocketGuidanceSystem/blob/main/main/main.ino 

Description: Lines 73-175 shows the process of code where it is apart of a rocket telemetry system. It is responsible for controlling a rocket’s trajectory based on readings and adjusting it accordingly.

Code for checking if an account has Spotify premium or not (⅓)

https://github.com/1LCB/Spotify-Checker/blob/main/SpotifyChecker.py 

Description: Lines 32-99 shows the process of code where it checks the account credentials and then see if it is valid or not and sees if they the account has premium. 

Sending notifications on your phone to you (⅔)

https://github.com/binwiederhier/ntfy/blob/main/cmd/serve_test.go 

Description: Lines 20-91 shows the process in which the code is a notification service, it’ll send notifications to your desktop or mobile device over a bunch of things grouped up into one section. 


Discovering champion counter picks in game LoL (3/3) 

https://github.com/Marwan01/LoL-champ-select/blob/master/scrapy.py 

Description: Lines 1-109 shows the code for the in game web application that shows counter picks and statistics for the champion that you are playing. All you have to do is to search the champion you are thinking of playing into it and you will be given loads of information for the champion ranging from its name, champions it counters, champions that counter it, tips, lanes, and etc.
